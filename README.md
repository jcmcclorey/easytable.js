# EasyTable.js
EasyTable.js is a simple VanillaJS solution for adding pagination, sorting and filtering to HTML tables whether the data is loaded on page render or via AJAX. The only caveat at the moment is a dependency on [Font Awesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free) for sorting icons.
